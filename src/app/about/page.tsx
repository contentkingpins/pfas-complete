            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              PFAS (Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) are a group of man-made chemicals that have been manufactured and used in a variety of industries around the globe since the 1940s. These chemicals are very persistent in the environment and in the human body â€“ meaning they don't break down and can accumulate over time.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              There are thousands of PFAS chemicals, and they can be found in many different consumer, commercial, and industrial products. This makes it challenging to study and assess the potential human health effects of PFAS exposure.
